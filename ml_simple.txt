# Introduction to Simple Machine Learning
Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. One of the simplest ML techniques is **Linear Regression**, which is widely used for predictive modeling.

Linear regression is a **supervised learning algorithm** that models the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) using a straight line.

# Understanding Linear Regression
Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the input variable (X) and the output variable (Y). The equation for a simple linear regression model is:

Y = mX + b

where:
- Y is the predicted output,
- X is the input feature,
- m is the slope of the line (coefficient), and
- b is the y-intercept.

The goal is to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the error between predicted and actual values.

# Training a Linear Regression Model
The model is trained using a dataset containing input-output pairs. The **Least Squares Method** is commonly used to minimize the sum of squared differences between actual and predicted values.

## Steps to Train:
1. Collect and preprocess data.
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Use an optimization technique (e.g., gradient descent) to adjust m and b.
4. Evaluate model performance using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared score**.

# Applications of Linear Regression
Linear regression is widely used in various domains, including:
- **Finance**: Stock price prediction
- **Marketing**: Sales forecasting
- **Healthcare**: Disease progression prediction
- **Economics**: Demand-supply analysis

Despite its simplicity, linear regression is a powerful tool for analyzing relationships between variables and making informed predictions. However, it assumes **linearity, no multicollinearity, and homoscedasticity**, which may limit its effectiveness in complex real-world scenarios.
