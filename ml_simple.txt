# Introduction to Simple Machine Learning
Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. One of the simplest ML techniques is **Linear Regression**, which is widely used for predictive modeling.

Linear regression is a **supervised learning algorithm** that models the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) using a straight line.
