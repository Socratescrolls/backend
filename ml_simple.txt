# Introduction to Simple Machine Learning
Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. One of the simplest ML techniques is **Linear Regression**, which is widely used for predictive modeling.

Linear regression is a **supervised learning algorithm** that models the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) using a straight line.

# Understanding Linear Regression
Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the input variable (X) and the output variable (Y). The equation for a simple linear regression model is:

Y = mX + b

where:
- Y is the predicted output,
- X is the input feature,
- m is the slope of the line (coefficient), and
- b is the y-intercept.

The goal is to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the error between predicted and actual values.
