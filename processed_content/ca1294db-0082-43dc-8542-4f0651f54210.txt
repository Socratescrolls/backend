Dear Hiring Committee, 
​
I'm a Computer Science graduate student at Tandon School of Engineering, currently in my 
second semester.  Having completed my undergrad in Computer Engineering, I have strong 
problem-solving skills and technical skills, including algorithms, machine learning,internet of 
things and software development. I have interned as a software development engineer at 
Expedia, gaining valuable experience collaborating with international teams.  
Having lived and studied in different parts of the world—including Ghana, Sri Lanka, Germany, 
Liberia, and India—I adapt quickly to new environments and connect easily with individuals 
from diverse backgrounds. This international exposure has given me a global perspective and 
a deep appreciation for diversity and inclusivity. Additionally, earning an International 
Baccalaureate Diploma further strengthened my understanding of cross-cultural interactions 
and global citizenship. 
Beyond academics, I am passionate about contributing to social causes. I initiated a cancer 
awareness campaign and donation drive in Colombo and have actively volunteered in various 
initiatives, including hospice care, refugee support (through Berliner Tafel), and English 
language learning in Berlin. More recently, I contributed to the World Wide Fund for Nature’s 
(WWF) Monsoon Biodiversity Survey in Delhi’s Sanjay Van, where I documented various 
species as part of a citizen science initiative. These experiences have reinforced my 
commitment to leveraging my skills for social good and making meaningful contributions to 
communities 
At NYU, I am equally committed to fostering a strong community. This semester, I serve as a 
Grad Life Ambassador and Treasurer for Design for America, a club that focuses on design for 
social impact projects. My involvement in these roles allows me to support my peers, 
encourage collaboration, and contribute to a culture of innovation and inclusivity. 
 
Besides my proficiency in English and Hindi, I hold a B2 level in French (DELF) and studied 
German during Grades 9 and 10 in Berlin.  I possess strong writing and research skills, having 
collaborated with PhD scholars during my undergraduate studies and delivering numerous 
presentations and reports in internships, volunteer roles, and coursework.  
 
I hope to have the opportunity to discuss with you the contribution I can make as a Graduate 
Assistant. I am available for an interview at your convenience and look forward to hearing 
from you. 
​
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
Sincerely,​
Yashavika Singh
